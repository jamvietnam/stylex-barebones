Stylex Barebones Modifyed
----------------

This is the example project that demonstrates getting started
with [Stylex](https://github.com/darrenmothersele/stylex) - atomic design, style guides, and prototyping
with Silex PHP, Twig templates, and YAML.
For more details [see this blog post](http://www.darrenmothersele.com/blog/2015/03/20/stylex-prototype-style-guide-tool/).

To get started run:

    1. -$ composer install
    2. -$ npm install
    3. -$ bower install

    If you are not in a php environment (MAMP / WAMP) you can run this on mac to view the site
    4. -$ php -S localhost:8000

    5. Open the grunt file and make sure the borwsersync proxy matches your path.
    6. run -$ grunt

The /public_html is just what works is configure on my computer. You can move this anywhere.
